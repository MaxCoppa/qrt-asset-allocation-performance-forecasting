# Deep Learning Models

This module explores deep learning approaches for time-series prediction in asset allocation.

## Components
- **Autoencoder + MLP**:  
  For representation learning and denoising of noisy allocation features.
- **LSTM with attention**:  
  To capture temporal dependencies and cross-allocation relationships.
- **Training utilities**:  
  Scripts for training, validation, and experiment logging.
